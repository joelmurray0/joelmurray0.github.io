Using links
Using multimedia (images / videos / embedded resources)
Basic Styling using external CSS files (for colour, layout, navigation, etc.)

The Web page submission is a single URL

Your planning document should include, as a minimum:

Designs for your page structures or graphical user interface (GUI); 
Screens or wireframes that show the flow of your web page, with explanations;

## Plan
* Create a page with multiple sections: an `About me`, `CS experience`, `Projects` and `More information`
* Create extra `subsections` (`pets`, `esports`, `subjects`, `text-to-action robot`, `github` and `website`) for easier access and understandability
* Create a framework for a card to be shifted in and out of the `viewing screen` (only 1 at a time to avoid clutter)
* Styling using bootstrap framework
* Add `icons` for clarity
* Removed normal link appearance but compensated for it with an icon where useful. All links are obvious.
* Coherent theme across the website
* Optimise for many devices - helps using grid system in bootstrap
